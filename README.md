<b>Notice – Early Research Prototype</b><br><br>
You are viewing an early <b>Proof of Concept (POC)</b> form of the <b>EMG – The EMERGENT GRAPH MODEL</b>.<br><br>
The <b>CEFS</b> was the first conceptual experiment aiming to bring mathematical reasoning closer to the domain of programming and system design.
Some initial ideas have since become outdated, while others — through several new theoretical directions — have rapidly evolved into a novel approach to
self-developing, self-configuring, and self-learning systems.<br><br>
Since this topic may overlap with dual-use research areas, the <b>EMG</b> will not be published publicly, even at the theoretical level.<br><br>

# Controlled Emergent Fractal System (CEFS)

CEFS is a new software architecture paradigm that treats knowledge and program logic not as a static, predefined structure, but as a living, dynamically evolving topological network.

This project is best viewed through our GitHub Pages site, which properly renders all documents, including mathematical formulas.

*   **[The Main Theoretical Framework (White Paper)](https://denware.github.io/cefs/CEFS-WH.html)**
*   **[The Detailed Mathematical Model](https://denware.github.io/cefs/CEFS-MATH.html)**
*   **[Proof of Concept Guide](https://denware.github.io/cefs/CEFS-PoC-Guide.html)**

## Quick Start: Trying Out the Proof of Concept

The project includes a runnable JavaScript Proof of Concept (PoC) file that demonstrates the fundamental learning cycle of CEFS in practice.

1.  **Download or clone the repository.**

2.  **Navigate to the project directory and run the code in a Node.js environment:**
    ```
    node CEFS-v5.3.js
    ```

3.  **Analyze the output:**
    The console output will show, step-by-step, the three-phase operation of CEFS: loading core knowledge (axioms), experiential learning (`learn`), abstraction (`infer`), and self-regulation (`optimize`).
