# Controlled Emergent Fractal System (CEFS)

CEFS is a new software architecture paradigm that treats knowledge and program logic not as a static, predefined structure, but as a living, dynamically evolving topological network.

*   **[The Detailed Mathematical Model](https://tamas-szots.github.io/cefs/CEFS-MATH.html)**: The formal mathematical description behind the system and the details of the three-phase learning model.
*   **[Proof of Concept Guide](https://tamas-szots.github.io/cefs/CEFS-PoC-Guide.html)**: A step-by-step guide that demonstrates the operation of the accompanying Proof of Concept code through a concrete example.

## Quick Start: Trying Out the Proof of Concept

The project includes a runnable JavaScript Proof of Concept (PoC) file that demonstrates the fundamental learning cycle of CEFS in practice.

1.  **Download or clone the repository.**

2.  **Navigate to the project directory and run the code in a Node.js environment:**
    ```
    node CEFS-v5.3.js
    ```

3.  **Analyze the output:**
    The console output will show, step-by-step, the three-phase operation of CEFS: loading core knowledge (axioms), experiential learning (`learn`), abstraction (`infer`), and self-regulation (`optimize`).
